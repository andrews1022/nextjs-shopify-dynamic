# Next.js + Shopify

This is a more fleshed out version of my previous Next.js + Shopify site, which you can see [here](https://github.com/andrews1022/nextjs-shopify-static)

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- styled-components
- Shopify

## Project Goals

- Product Page
  - Different color swatches for variants, clicking on one instantly changes image
- Products
  - Different styles for product card if out of stock
- Checkout
  - Be able to add products to cart, and modify / delete products (cart comes in from the right)
  - When you click checkout, go to checkout page
- Have banner / popup noting this is just a site for development, and you should not actually buy anything
- Pages
  - Home page
  - collections pages
  - individual product page
  - privacy and terms page
  - checkout page (simply display message saying _thank you, but this is a test store, and your cart has been cleared_, and have cta to go back home)
